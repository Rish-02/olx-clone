OLX-Clone

<h5>Here is the OLX clone that I build with MERN Stack</h5>

A multi-vendor marketplace where anyone can signup and buy/sell stuff they don't need anymore. It has a great client app. Major features are Categories, Filters, Details page, Ad Views, and Clicks. Users can post new ads, delete their ads update their ads. They can update their profile.

This project is made as an assignment for an internship application. But I'll take this project forward in future and add other functionalities like searching and user management as well.

It also includes features like jwt authentication, google places.

Tech used in this project:
1- Reactjs
2- Redux
3- Nodejs
4- Expressjs
5- Mongodb
7- Google Places Autocomplete Api
8- JWT Auth
